Simplified overengineered build, test and meta pipeline.

- removed runner, metaCollector, metaReplacer
- removed hook file nesting
- extraced file collection script
- using JSDoc data instead of separate meta
- switched to namespaces for hook types
- updated JSDoc tables
- using react.types where possible
