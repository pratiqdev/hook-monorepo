# Hook documentation


Pages for individual hooks will contain more information about how to configure
and use them. Examples and descriptions are also provided by JsDoc comments, if 
your editor of choice supports it.

Most hooks will provide:

- A description
- Live code examples
- Config and return definitions
- Method explanations and examples
- Internal functions and hooks
- Related hooks
