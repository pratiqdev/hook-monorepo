# @pratiq/hooks


**This package provides a collection of hooks for simplifying the React development experience.**



React development can be both exciting and challenging. You can create impressive user interfaces, 
but it can also be quite complicated to manage state, handle side effects, and deal with repetitive 
code. Fortunately, `@pratiq/hooks` can make your React development process much more efficient and less tedious.

With this library, you can quickly and easily implement complex features in your React application, 
without having to write a lot of code from scratch. Its an open-source project available on GitHub 
as a monorepo. We also offer an npm package for easy installation. 

Designed with the needs of developers in mind - these hooks are easy to use, 
well-documented internally with JSDoc, and tested to ensure that they work as intended. This 
documentation site also provides comprehensive instructions for setup and usage, as well as interactive
demos of every hook to help you get started.

### What is a hook?

A hook is a function or functional-component that isolates reusable pieces 
of logic or state. You have likely seen a hook or function resemling the following
example:

```ts
const useSomething = (initialState, options) => {
    // store some state
    const [value, setValue] = useState(initialState)
    
    // handle the new value
    const handleValue = (newValue) => {
        if ( typeof newValue === 'string' && newValue.length > 5 ){
            setValue(newValue)
            return true
        }else{
            return false
        }
    }

    // return the state and the handler
    return [value, handleValue]
}
