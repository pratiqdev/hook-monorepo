# @pratiq/hooks


**This package provides a collection of hooks for simplifying the React development experience.**  This package, available on npm or GitHub, provides a set of React hooks designed to minimize 
repetative logic within components. No hooks, utilities or functions here use or return ReactNodes, 
JSX elements, or HTML of any kind. They are meant to be drop-in solutions for common patterns and
issues with React development like managing events, handling user input, or managing non-destructive
operations the 'React' way.
