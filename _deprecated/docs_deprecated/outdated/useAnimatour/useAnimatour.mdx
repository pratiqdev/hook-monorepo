:::caution Breaking Changes
@pratiq/animatour has been deprecated in favor of this, a hook based `useAnimatour`. This has
breaking changes from previous versions and includes a full rebuild of the state management
mechanisms and tour component creation.

Due to the size and complexity of the animatour package, documentation, guides and demos; it will
likely be released as a standalone package, with its own rich documentation.

Some documentation will appear here as an introduction but, stay tuned for the full release or 
keep an eye on the repo at `github.com/pratiqdev/animatour` @ `v3`
